History of Gist (Python Modules):  pgyist/gist

V041124 Michiel de Hoon

        1.  Add missing colorbar.py.

V030616 Michiel de Hoon

        1.  gist.py:  plh (plot histogram): Added a keyword (height) 
            for font size of labels.

V030505 Michiel de Hoon

        1.  movie.py:  time (in original yorick script) was changed to timing
            to avoid onflict with the time module, but two occurrences 
            were missed.

        2.  Added gistdemomovie.py.

V030422 Chase

        1.  Add pl3d.py, plwf.py, movie.py, yorick.py, slice3.py, demo5.py
            from gist3d (identified by Michiel as the relevant files
            supporting pygist's 3D plotting capabilities documented in
            the manual). 

        2.  Rename demo5.py gistdemo3d.py.  Add messages where missing
            to give some notion of what is plotted.  Comment out tests
            requiring PR (from the obsolete pyPDB) and PDB/Silo data files
            that are no longer available.

V030407 Michiel de Hoon

        1.  gist.py:  Modifications to plh to add labels below x-axis; 
            removed legend and added label keyword.

V030407 Chase 

        1.  gistdemolow.py:  Add plh test.
    
V030407 Chase

        1.  LLNL-specific:  Add addPyGistTracker.py. 

V030319 Chase

        1.  gist.py: Dave Grote reported a bug in plfc:  
            nc == None should be nc is None, so it will work for
            any python object (including Numeric arrays). 
            At the end of plfc, the following is now included:
            if (is_scalar(nc) and nc == 0 or nc is None) :
               continue

V030314 Chase

        1.  Add test 23 (test of plfp) to gistdemolow.py.

V030312 Chase

        1.  Add version and help comments to gist.py; update doc.

V030306 Chase

        1.  wxtest.py:  Used information from Dave Grote to show
            how wxPython can be used for a GUI in conjunction with PyGist. 

V021227 Michiel de Hoon 

        1.  gist.py:  Add plh implementation.

V021126 Chase

        1.  gist.py:  Add plmk documentation.

V011203 Chase

        1.  gistdemolow.py:  Correct titles for test 12 and test 18.
            Add title for Cartoids plots.

V011105 Chase

        1.  gist.py:  Import help from pydoc instead of the original
            help.py.  help.py and shapetest.py are really no longer required.

V011030 Chase

        1.  gistdemolow.py:  Disable is_scalar test.  Cannot get type
            of multiarray object or rank-0 array.

            *** Demo has many blank screens.

        2.  gist.py:

            This old gist package had gist.py, gist.help, help.py, and 
            help.help.  With pydoc now available in python, the help 
            mechanism is now obsolete.  Merge the documentation in gist.help 
            into the gist.py source, so pydoc can pick up the doc strings.

            *** Not all the commands are in gist.py.  Some are in the C source.

V011029 Chase

        1.  Add Graphics/Arrayfcns/Lib/shapetest.py from LLNLDistribution11.

        2.  Initially added __init__.py to this directory, but that turns
            it into a package, so have to access gist.gist.  Also 
            gistCmodule.so gets stored at the top level under site-packages.
            Chose to use Numeric's way of putting everything in the directory.

V011019 Chase

        1.  This directory contains the Python modules 
            gist.py, gist.help, help.py, help.help from
            LLNLDistribution11 tar file on the ftp-icf.llnl.gov server.
            The files were in Graphics/Gist/Lib.
